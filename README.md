Attempting the Rustlings exercises to get acquanited with the popular systems programming language, Rust. Planning to use this as a stepping stone for OpenGL graphic programming stuff, backend and ML optimizations!

Using the following resources:
1. **The Rust Book**: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html
